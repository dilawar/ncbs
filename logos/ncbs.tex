% NCBS Bangalore logo in LATEX.
% I have tried to keep colors as true as possible.

\documentclass[tikz,preview,trim=true]{standalone}
\usepackage{xcolor}

\definecolor{ncbsgreen}{rgb}{0.07,0.29,0.09}
\definecolor{ncbsred}{rgb}{0.20,0.40,0.11}
\definecolor{ncbstext}{rgb}{0.18,0.18,0.18}

\begin{document}

\begin{tikzpicture}

    \foreach \i in {0,1,...,15}
        \draw[ncbsgreen,very thick,smooth] plot file{path\i.txt};


\end{tikzpicture}

\end{document}
